PosSystem-BackEnd-Spring

This project involves developing a back-end RESTful API for a POS (Point of Sale) system using the Spring Framework. The system follows a clean, layered architecture, utilizing Spring Web MVC for handling HTTP requests, Spring Data JPA with Hibernate for managing database operations, and MySQL as the relational database. Communication between the front end and back end is facilitated using AJAX or fetch, ensuring real-time interaction. The back end also includes robust logging mechanisms for tracking events and operations. The project is fully documented with detailed API information, linked to the README.md file, and includes a proper license. Best coding practices are maintained throughout the development to ensure the code is maintainable, scalable, and efficient.

Front End

The POS system's front end is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides user-friendly interfaces to perform essential operations, including adding, updating, deleting, and viewing customers and items, with a primary focus on placing orders. These operations are supported by the back end through RESTful APIs, ensuring seamless communication and integration between the front end and back end.
